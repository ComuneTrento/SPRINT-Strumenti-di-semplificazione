      Adaptation Engine Model Repository
    longDescription: >
      This tool is provided on behalf of the SPRINT project. SPRINT project
      intends to prepare a kit that enhances and re-uses some components
      developed by the SIMPATICO project.
      
      This module exposes the components of Text Adaptation Engine (TAE),
      Authoring Supporting Tool (AST). Workflow Adaptation Engine (WAE)
      developed in the context of the EU SIMPATICO project.


      TAE allows you to adapt/modify the text to improve readability and
      understanding.  AST provides a set of tools to measure the readability
      level of a descriptive text. WAE is responsible for adapting and
      simplifying the interaction with e-services. 


      The configuration of the module consists of the installation of
      server-side components and in a front-end configuration as part of the
      Interactive Front-End (IFE) configuration.
    features:
      - Text Simplification (TAE)
      - Workflow Simplification (WAE)
      - Text Complexity Analysis (AST)
